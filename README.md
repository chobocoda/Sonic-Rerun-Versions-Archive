# Sonic Rerun Versions Archive

## This is an archive of all versions of Sonic Rerun, the Sonic 1 ROM Hack that you *don't* really love! 
Please credit me if you use ANY of these assets. They suck, but I spent time on it.

Extras contain things that weren't really a main part of Sonic Rerun, but were "still the life of the party".
This contains a "50Hz" fix which just replaces the sound driver with the original SMPS 68k driver.
The "Sonic Rerun 2" was a planned sequel/successor of some sorts that didn't get very far (probably because Sonic Rerun's codebase sucks).
